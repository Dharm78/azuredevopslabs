### What's covered in this lab

This lab shows how you can use **WhiteSource Bolt with Azure DevOps** to automatically detect alerts on vulnerable open source components, outdated libraries, and license compliance issues in your code.

Azure DevOps integration with WhiteSource Bolt will enable you to:

1. Detect and remedy vulnerable open source components.
1. Generate comprehensive open source inventory reports per project or build.
1. Enforce open source license compliance, including dependenciesâ€™ licenses.
1. Identify outdated open source libraries with recommendations to update.

### Before you begin

1.Use https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whitesource.whiteSource-bolt-v2 to provision the WhiteSource project on your Azure DevOps Organization.

## Exercise 1: Activate WhiteSource Bolt

In your Azure DevOps Project, under **Pipelines** section, go to **PartsUnlimitedt** build pipeline and edit it.Add the **whitesource bolt** task and save the yaml file.

## Exercise 3: Analyze Reports

WhiteSource bolt automatically detects OpenSource components in the software including transitive dependencies and their respective licenses.

### Security Dashboard

The security dashboard shows the vulnerability of the build.
This report shows the list of all vulnerable open source components with **Vulnerability Score, Vulnerable Libraries, Severity Distribution**.

You can see the opensource license distribution and a detailed view of all components and links to their metadata and licensed references.

### Outdated Libraries

WhiteSource Bolt also tracks outdated libraries in the project, getting all the detailed information and links to newer versions and recommendations.
